# Heart-attack-prediction

## Overview

The Heart Attack Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health parameters. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project analyzes historical patient data to identify risk factors and provide actionable insights for preventive healthcare.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of health data to identify key risk factors.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various algorithms (e.g., logistic regression,random forest ,svm, xgboost,) for prediction.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple interface for users to input data and receive predictions.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to present data insights and model performance.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup, usage, and model interpretation this is the link of presentation(https://gamma.app/docs/Heart-Disease-Prediction-System-j6pjwg7wl7jcae5?mode=doc)
- 

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Framework**: Flask (for web interface)
